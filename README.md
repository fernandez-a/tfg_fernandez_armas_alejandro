# DETR for wine leaves disease detection

This repository contains the implementation of DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model for early detection of wine leaf diseases. The project is part of the work developed for my Bachelor's Thesis, aimed at providing accurate and efficient detection of diseases in vineyards using deep learning.
